	        SaltCity is a joyous community of Word Livers. We are committed to the studying, teaching and application of God’s Word in all of life.
	        <br><br>
	        We believe in the divine inspiration and the absolute authority of the Christian Bible. We believe the Bible is inerrant (incapable of error) in it’s content and altogether sufficient for faith (belief) and practice (behavior).
	        <br><br>
	        Our mission is to equip an army with the Word of God and charge them to be doers of the Word. Simply put, SaltCity exists to get people into the Word so that they can carry it into the world. Our stories are simple, just like yours.
